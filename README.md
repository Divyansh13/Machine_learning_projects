## Machine_learning_projects
This repository contains my first personal Machine Learning Projects. To view my notebook directly from github, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Belows are brief descriptions and images about my projects: 

- **Dog and Cat classification project** (Notebook link: https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Dog_Cat_classification/Dog_Cat_classification.ipynb)  
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/30k1jgs contains 25,000 images of dog and cat collected from Internet. 
  - My model contains 3 Conv2d layers in the hidden layer and 2 dense layers for output. In total there are approximately 13 millions parameters. Eventually the accuracy of my model achieved was 87.8%.

- **Fashion classification with fashion_mnnist datasets of Keras**: (Notebook link:  https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Fashion_classification/Fashion_classification.ipynb)
  - Dataset: The fashion_mnist datasets of Keras contains of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
  - My model consists of 597,786 parameters and was trained for 10 epochs. The accuracy is nearly 95%

- **Traffic classisfication with YOLOv3**: (Notebook link: https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Traffic_classification/Traffic_classification_YOLOv3.ipynb)
  - Dataset: COCO dataset is a large-scale object-detection dataset which contains of approximately 330K images. 
  - In this project, I applied YOLOv3 algorithm on the dataset of COCO and pass an image and video through. The results can be seen as below figures:
