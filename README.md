## Machine_learning_projects
This repository contains my first personal Machine Learning Projects. To view my notebook directly from github, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Belows are brief descriptions and images about my projects: 

- [**Dog and Cat classification project**](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/tree/master/Dog_Cat_classification):
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/30k1jgs contains 25,000 images of dog and cat collected from Internet. 
  - My customized model contains 12 layers had achieved accuracy 87.8%. Used transfer learning with pre-trained Resnet50, I have imporved my model accuracy up to nearly 98%.

- [**Fashion classification with fashion_mnnist datasets of Keras**](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/tree/master/Fashion_classification):
  - Dataset: The fashion_mnist datasets of Keras contains of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
  - My model consists of 597,786 parameters and was trained for 10 epochs. The accuracy is nearly 95%

- [**Traffic signs classification with German Traffic Sign dataset on Kaggle**](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/tree/master/Traffic_signs_classification):
  - Dataset: The Kaggle German Traffic Sign dataset onsists of 40 classes and more than 50,000 images in total.
  - The mode created in this project contains 478,763 parameter and was trained for 20 epochs. The final accuracy after testing with new test data is 96.8%

- [**Traffic classisfication with YOLOv3**](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/tree/master/Traffic_classification_Yolov3):
  - Dataset: COCO dataset is a large-scale object-detection dataset which contains of approximately 330K images. 
  - In this project, I applied YOLOv3 algorithm on the dataset of COCO and pass an image and video through. The results can be seen as below figures:

- [**Gun detection with Yolov3**](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/tree/master/Gun_detection_Yolov3)
  - [Dataset](http://www.mediafire.com/file/pvfircmboaelkxc/Gun_data_labeled.zip/file): 3k images of hand gun and their label annotation (bounding box cordination)
  - Model was trained on Colab with 900 epochs using Yolov3.
